## Day 1 Spec-to-Implementation (Recipe Class)

Clone the repo, open it in IntelliJ (Get from VCS), run `Main`.

Our job today is to implement the TODOs in `Recipe.java` using an LLM so that the program output matches the spec in `SPEC.md`.

Suggested workflow:
1. Read `SPEC.md`
2. Run `Main` (it should compile, but output will be wrong until you implement TODOs)
3. Implement one method at a time
4. Make small commits with meaningful messages
